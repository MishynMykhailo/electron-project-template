# Electron template

## This template includes technologies:

<ul>
<li>Electron</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>Webpack</li>
</ul>

## Why I make this template?
I've been looking for a long time for a good electron development template, but it didn't work for me. After I read the documentation and was able to put together a +- working template and I want to keep it. Because, it will help me in the future.
